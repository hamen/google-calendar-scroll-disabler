This Chrome Extension fixes this annoying behavior and disables the scroll on the calendar grid in Google Calendar. You won't be able to navigate to next/previous month using the scroll. You will have to use the arrows `<` `>` buttons, as normal people expect it to be.

## Installation

You can find the latest version on the Chrome WebStore:
